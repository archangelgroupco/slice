	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// subsetCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	subsetCmd.Flags().StringP("manifest-file", "f", "", "source manifest file")
	subsetCmd.Flags().StringP("subset-file-name", "o", "", "name of the output subset file")
	// subsetCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
